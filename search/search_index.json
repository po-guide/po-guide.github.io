It has a chord mode, with 16 different chords able to be chained together like patterns. The melodic scale that the sounds play in changes in accordance with the current chord. Based on chord mode, the PO-20 also has a \"chord machine\" function which plays a drone of whatever chord is active. The drone is able to be sidechained to the kick sound. The PO-20's design is of an arcade cabinet.</p>"},{"location":"#po-24-office","title":"PO-24 - Office","text":"<p>A groovebox inspired by vintage office equipment.

It has control over each part's pitch and morph (blend between two sounds). Tonic can have sounds and patches replaced by data transferred from MicroTonic using the microphone/line in. Its design is of people drinking at a bar and was made by Ivana Kouthoofd, the nine-year-old daughter of Teenage Engineering's CEO.</p>"},{"location":"#po-33-ko","title":"PO-33 - K.O!","text":"<p>A sampler. Samples can be recorded through line in or microphone and sorted into one of eight melodic tracks or one of eight drum tracks. Melodic tracks are capable of playing chromatically while drum tracks are played as hits. The K.O! has a maximum timbrality of four samples, but all samples are monophonic. Each track has a multi-mode digital filter (with control over resonance) which can be controlled by the sequencer. The K.O! can back-up and load data as audio. The design is of a boxing match.</p>"},{"location":"#po-35-speak","title":"PO-35 - Speak","text":"<p>A speech synthesizer. It has 16 tracks, of which 1-15 use the speech synthesis engine and 16 uses a monophonic 16 part version of the PO-32's sound engine. Sounds are used in the PO-35 by recording through the microphone or line-in. The PO-35 has a total of 120 seconds of recording memory: Eight seconds per slot. There are eight voices to choose from for the speech engine: Natural, Autotune, Retro, Noise, Robot, Fifth, Vocoder and Synth. Control over each engine is made using the Pitch, Formant, Start point and Speed parameters. Unlike other Pocket Operators, the Speech only has eight effects. The PO-35 can play in four scales named Major, Minor, Blues and Arab. Its design is of a group of people talking.</p>"},{"location":"#limited-editions","title":"Limited Editions","text":""},{"location":"#po-33-ghostly-edition-ko","title":"PO-33 - Ghostly Edition (K.O!)","text":"<p>In April 2019, a limited edition run was created of the PO-33 K.O!.
